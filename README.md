- **Organizational Insights**: Team capability mapping and knowledge distribution analysis

### Latest Analysis Results (Generated: 2025-08-22)
- **Developer Analyzed**: dang-w (8-year frontend/backend developer)
- **Commits Processed**: 7 across 16 repositories with 12-month temporal analysis
- **Experience Level**: Senior (correctly identified)
- **Top Skills**: JSON (10/10), Python (4.2/10), TypeScript (3.8/10)
- **Analysis Time**: 35 seconds
- **Cost**: ~$0.02-0.05

**Note**: Current skill scoring has known limitations (see [Areas Requiring Refinement](#-areas-requiring-refinement) for details)

## üîß Configuration

Configuration is handled via environment variables in `.env` file:

```bash
# Copy the example file and edit it
cp .env.example .env

# Required settings:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-openai-api-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your-github-token-here  # For higher API limits (5000/hr vs 60/hr)
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username

# Optional settings:
ANALYSIS_MONTHS=12                        # How far back to analyze
MAX_REPOSITORIES=20                       # Repository analysis limit
MAX_COMMITS_PER_REPO=100                 # Commit limit per repository
```

### GitHub Token Setup
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Required permissions: `public_repo` + `read:user`
4. Copy token and add to `.env` file

üìä **View Complete Results**: See [Proof of Concept Results](docs/proof_of_concept_results.md) for detailed validation, limitations, and organizational deployment strategy.

## üö® Areas Requiring Refinement

Current limitations identified during validation:

1. **Skill Scoring Accuracy**: AI may underestimate proficiency in certain languages (e.g., TypeScript 3.8/10 for experienced developer)
2. **File Extension Bias**: Over-weights JSON/config files vs actual programming complexity
3. **Limited Commit Sample**: 7 commits may not represent full skill breadth
4. **Context Understanding**: AI lacks deep comprehension of work complexity in specific technologies

üîß **Improvement Plan**: See [Technical Limitations & Solutions](docs/proof_of_concept_results.md#areas-requiring-refinement) for detailed refinement strategy.

## üè¢ Organizational Integration Strategy

For enterprise deployment considerations:

- **Multi-Project Analysis**: Cross-repository skill assessment
- **Team Collaboration Patterns**: Pull request and code review integration
- **Enhanced Data Sources**: JIRA tickets, documentation repos, architecture diagrams
- **Advanced Analytics**: Skill gap analysis, mentorship matching, project staffing optimization

üìà **Full Strategy**: See [Organizational GitHub Integration](docs/proof_of_concept_results.md#organizational-github-integration-strategy) for comprehensive deployment planning.

## üí° Key Insights from Development

1. **GitHub commits contain rich skill indicators** beyond just language usage - temporal progression analysis reveals learning patterns
2. **AI can effectively identify patterns** in coding practices, documentation quality, and project complexity
3. **Personalized recommendations** are significantly more valuable than generic training programs
4. **Privacy-first approach** builds developer trust and encourages voluntary adoption
5. **Cost-effective at scale** - $0.02-0.05 per assessment enables organization-wide deployment
6. **Skill scoring requires refinement** - current limitations acknowledged and improvement strategies defined
