## üîç Technical Implementation Insights

### Temporal Analysis Implementation
**Skill progression tracking over time**
- **Approach:** Analyze commits across 12-month window for skill development patterns
- **Repository Selection:** Analyze top 20 repositories by activity for comprehensive coverage
- **Benefits:**
  - Show skill development trajectory over time
  - Identify learning patterns and preferences
  - Detect technology adoption and specialization changes
  - Evidence of increasing project complexity and responsibility
- **Challenges:**
  - Based on personal profile, so results skewed heavily by interest and personal focuses, rather than professional development work
  - 6 month window selected for proof of concept may not provide results that are necessarily reperesentative of dev skills, based on project focuses. May need to be expanded for full temporal growth analysis benefit

### Data Collection Success
**Successful data points extracted:**
- **Commits Analyzed:** 7 commits with detailed file-level analysis
- **Repositories Scanned:** 16 repositories for comprehensive coverage
- **Temporal Progression Tracked:** Skill development over time
- **Language Proficiency Detected:** 10 programming languages/technologies identified
- **Documentation Quality Scored:** README and documentation analysis completed
- **Collaboration Patterns Identified:** Repository ownership and contribution patterns
- **API Requests Used:** ~150 requests (well within authenticated 5,000/hour limit)
- **Skill Development Trends:** Learning trajectory analysis

### AI Analysis Accuracy & Limitations
- **Language Detection**: 100% accurate identification of primary technologies used
- **Experience Assessment**: Correctly identified senior-level capabilities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Successfully identified project-based learning style
- **Specialization Detection**: Accurately recognized backend/data focus

### Areas Requiring Refinement
**Current Limitations Identified:**
- **Skill Proficiency Scoring**: TypeScript (3.8/10) and JavaScript (0.1/10) ratings appear underestimated for an 8-year developer with significant frontend experience
- **File Extension Bias**: Analysis may over-weight JSON manipulation vs actual programming language proficiency
- **Context Understanding**: AI may not fully grasp the complexity of work done in specific technologies
- **Commit Scope**: Limited to 7 commits may not represent full skill breadth

**Required Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced Prompting**: Refine AI prompts to better weight different types of code contributions
2. **Expanded Data Window**: Increase commit analysis beyond current sample size
3. **Contextual Scoring**: Develop better understanding of file types and their complexity indicators
4. **Validation Framework**: Implement developer self-validation feedback loop
5. **Multi-Model Analysis**: Use multiple AI models for cross-validation of assessments

### Cost Analysis & Performance Metrics
```
Analysis Cost Breakdown:
- OpenAI API calls: ~$0.50 per developer
- GitHub API calls: Free (with authenticated token)
- Processing time: ~30-45 seconds per analysis
- Total cost per developer: $0.50

Rate Limits & Scalability:
- Unauthenticated GitHub API: 60 requests/hour
- Authenticated GitHub API: 5,000 requests/hour
- OpenAI API: No practical limits for this use case
- Concurrent analyses possible: ~100 developers/hour

Monthly Cost Projections:
- 50 developers: $25/month
